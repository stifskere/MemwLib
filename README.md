# MemwLib

This is a library made for convenient implementations that microsoft did not add to C#, or are not good enough.

(in my opinion)

# Documentation

The documentation for this whole library is done trough XML for the moment, but in the future there will be an actual documentation page *maybe served with this library HTTP server*.

# Contributing

Simply make a pull request.
