# MemwLib

This library was made with the intention of making some of the pre-implemented features in the language more handful.

# Documentation

The documentation is being developed in my [portfolio site](https://memw.es), expect to find tutorials and XML maps there soon.

# Contributing

Please make a pull request and it will be reviewed as soon as possible.

# Downloading

This library is available in [NuGet as MemwLib](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MemwLib), or you can download the assembly in the releases section of this github repository (may be outdated)
